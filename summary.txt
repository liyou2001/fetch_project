1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?

I chose NodeJS with the Express framework for this coding exercise because of its simplicity. 
I think that for a small project, NodeJS is easy to setup, use, and understand. It is also a framework
in which I have a lot of experience in.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?

I used a linked list to store the transactions, which allows for constant time insertion of transactions 
at the start and end of the list. I think that one advantage that this has over an array is the deletion 
of transactions. When calling the /spend endpoint, I want to delete extra transactions from the list so 
that there isn't a bunch of linked list nodes with 0 points in it, which may increase the runtime of future
operations that require traversal.
